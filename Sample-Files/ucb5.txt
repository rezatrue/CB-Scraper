REFERENCES OF MATTHEW BIGA
To Whom It May Concern:

At my last job, I worked for my parents’ at their Quizno’s Subs, which recently closed due to the recent economic downturn. While working there I helped with supervising employees, trained new employees, took inventory, dealt with customer relations, and did other basic employee duties.

During my first year in college, I was offered the opportunity by my professor, Bob Dullock, to design Standard Operating

 
Procedure (SOP) manuals for local restaurants in Midland County. Unfortunately, I didn’t have much time left in Midland to design more than one manual, but I did complete one for a local mini-brewery, Midland Brewing Company.

If you agree that my qualifications would make me a strong addition to your team, please call me at (*10) *41-30*3, or e-mail me at bigamatt@gmail.com to schedule an interview. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Matthew D. Biga
